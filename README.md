Twitter weather updates...via Rick and Morty memes!

This project uses
* danieldiekmeier's memegenerator: https://github.com/danieldiekmeier/memegenerator
* OpenWeatherMap: weather data
* csparpa's open weather map python wrapper: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm
* Twitter API
* geduldig's TwitterAPI wrapper: https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI

Thank you to all these projects for their hard work so I could make a dumb RickAndMorty Weather Memebot

A virtual environment is included with all dependencies.  You'll need to get an OpenMap API key as well as a Twitter API key to run this.  They are both free, just drop them in the config/api_keys file in this repo and it will pick them up.
